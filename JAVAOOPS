class extends class , class implements interface , interface extends interface
ABSTRACT -> class can't be instantiate

      ->variable-> not be reinitialised,should be initialized while declaring or initialize in constructor
	  ->method-> can't be overridden
encapsulation -> get,set
object() class
mutable
immutable
static keyword	  
cohesion -> high cohesion -> restricted task,good software design(seperate class for each job)
         -> low cohesion -> worst case of design ,have lot of task
coupling->tighly coupled -> have more dependence
        -> loosly coupled -> have less dependence
single responsibility principles -> one class should have one and only responsibility
open close principle -> open for extension and close for modification
