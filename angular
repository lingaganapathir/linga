What is the difference between directive and the component?
Component is used to break up the application into smaller components.
But Directive is used to design re-usable components, which is more 
behavior-oriented. That is why components are widely used in later
versions of Angular to make things easy and build a total component-based model.

module : collection of components or components are grouped together to form module

service: to pass values from component to component

routing: things to do in routing module:
         import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
         const routes: Routes = [
           { path: '',
             redirectTo: '/login',
             pathMatch: 'full' 
            },
            {
              path: 'login',
              component: LoginComponent
            }
         ];
		 @NgModule({
           imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
           exports: [RouterModule]
         })
		 
ways to use it:
  define this in constructor of that ts file: private router: Router
  inside function: this.router.navigateByUrl('/list');
  in <a> tag: <a routerLink="/login">click here to login.</a>
